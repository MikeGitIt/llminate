# Claude Code Debugging Options

## Main Debugging Flags

### --verbose
The primary debugging flag for Claude Code CLI is `--verbose`. This flag enables verbose logging and shows the full turn-by-turn output, which is helpful for debugging in both print and interactive modes.

Example usage:
```
claude-code --verbose "Explain this code"
```

When using verbose mode, Claude Code will display:
- Connection status
- Request timing
- Network-related issues
- Which files Claude is analyzing (prefixed with "Building context...")
- Tool usage with parameters (prefixed with "Executing tool:")
- Communication with Anthropic servers (prefixed with "API request:")

Note that full API payloads are not shown for security reasons.

### --include-partial-messages
This flag can be used with `--print` and `--output-format=stream-json` to include partial streaming events in the output. This is useful for debugging streaming behavior.

Example usage:
```
claude-code --print --output-format=stream-json --include-partial-messages "Generate a function"
```

### --permission-prompt-tool
This flag allows you to specify an MCP tool to handle permission prompts in non-interactive mode, which can help debug permission-related issues.

## Best Practices for Debugging

1. Create a knowledge base of verbose output patterns and their solutions to accelerate future debugging.

2. For production deployments using Claude Code in automated workflows, consider capturing verbose output in your monitoring systems.

3. Enable verbose mode when Claude Code returns unexpected errors or fails silently, as it reveals the exact point of failure.

Note: There is no specific `--debug` flag in Claude Code CLI. The `--verbose` flag is the main option for debugging purposes.
